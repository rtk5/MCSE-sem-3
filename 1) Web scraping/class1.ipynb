      "A sample pretreatment method applicable toHi-C high throughput sequencing and library construction, comprising: freezing a test biological sample and fixing same by cross-linking. The freeze substitutionHi-C technique (FS-Hi-C) provided by said method is applicable not only to a fresh sample but also to a frozen sample stored in liquid nitrogen. Said method uses a freeze substitution (FS) technique to prepare anHi-C sample of a liquid nitrogen (LN2) frozen sample, so as to prevent sample from changing in the three-dimensional structure in a temperature rising process after being removed from a liquid nitrogen solution, solving a biological problem of how to use a sample frozen and stored in a low-temperature to study a three-dimensional chromosome structure thereof. Said method is evaluated in Drosophila, cotton, soybeans, and radish, and by means of observation by a high-voltage frozen transmission electron microscope, it is found that a freeze substitution (FS) sample and a fresh sample have highly similar three-dimensional chromatin structures, and the data quality ofHi-C libraries of cotton and Drosophila can be improved. FS-Hi-C exhibits a high degree of consistency in terms of chromatin interaction, A/B compartment, and TAD compared to conventionalHi-C pretreatment methods. Moreover, the library constructed by the FS-Hi-C method has a better quality, increased library capacity, greater amount of effectively interacting data, and reduced repeated data generated by PCR amplification. Said method reduces the requirements for the timeliness of a sample, and facilitates acquisition and storage of a sample. Said method overcomes the limitation for anHi-C experimental sample, can efficiently capture a three-dimensional chromosome conformation of a frozen biological sample, improves the data quality of biologicalHi-C, and provides an improved method for the application ofHi-C in research.\n",

      "A method of building aHi-C library, including, processing a cell using a solution having greater than 1% of formaldehyde, thereby fixing chromatin, and in a DNA purification step, adopting a sodium hydroxide solution to wash the fixed carrier, thus improving a ratio of usable data of a library.\n",
      "The invention provides a process for the manufacture of Hl 6 dimethanesulfonate comprising contacting an O-protected pyridine aidoxime compound with bis(methylsulphonoxymethyl) ether in a suitable solvent to form an intermediate compound, contacting said intermediate compound with isonicotinamide to form an O-protectedHI6 product precursor, and de- protecting the precursor to formHI6 dimethanesulfonate.\n",
      "The invention discloses aHi-Fi audio adapter, and belongs to the technical field of audio processing. TheHi-Fi audio adapter is provided with an electric control board which is provided with an audio digital-to-analog conversion circuit and an earphone amplification circuit. Conversion processing ofHi-Fi audio signals is supported by the audio digital-to-analog conversion circuit. After conversion processing from digital signals to analog signals is performed on the received digital audio signal, one path is outputted to an audio output terminal and the other path is transmitted to the earphone amplification circuit and then outputted to an earphone socket after power amplification processing of the earphone amplification circuit. TheHi-Fi audio adapter can be plugged on existing sound source equipment like a computer, a set top box and a CD player which cannot meet theHi-Fi output requirement and is used for adaption output of theHi-Fi audio signals of the sound source equipment and pushing rear-end sound producing equipment or a high-resistance earphone to realize perfect presentation of high-fidelity sound.\n",
      "The invention provides aHi-C library construction method. The method comprises the following steps: cross-linking DNA and protein in a sample cell, carrying out enzyme digestion on DNA in a cross-linked body, adding a sequencing joint, reconnecting a DNA fragment, de-cross-linking, adding a library joint, and carrying out library amplification. By adopting theHi-C library construction method disclosed by the invention, theHi-C library which is short in library construction time, low in cost, convenient in experimental operation and high in effective data proportion can be realized.\n",
